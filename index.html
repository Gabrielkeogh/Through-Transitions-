Life can bring major life changes that trigger emotions such as fear, shock, confusion, isolation and a sense of being out of control. Nothing feels the same or ever will be again for you. All of these are a response to the feelings of loss and grief.
    <br>
    <br>
Simultaneously letting go of and holding on to someone you love at the same time can feel impossible. Living with a loved one who has an incurable life limiting illness can cause feelings of grief to occur well before the time of actual death. Anticipatory grief is a very normal part of coming to terms with a very sad and diï¬ƒcult situation and the chaos that this devastating situation can bring. Sadly, this can also be a difficult for you to talk about in the everyday world, where those around you may be afraid to talk about what is happening to you out of a fear of saying the wrong thing, making the situation worse or adding to your suffering.
        <br>
        <br>
Your current situation may also be reminding you of previous bereavements, traumas or unresolved situations that are adding to and complicating the pain and chaos you are currently experiencing. My many years of working as a Macmillan specialist nurse in palliative care and end of life services gives me a deep understanding of the many dimensions exp of pre and post bereavement. I am a qualified counsellor working with a wide range of models and theories to support your individual experience and situation that work towards healing and integration of parts that you may have disconnected from in times of trauma and chaos. I recognise and value each person as an individual with their own life, personality, feelings, experiences and stories that are significant and unique.
