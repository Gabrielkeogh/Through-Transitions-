    About me
  </h2>
  <p class="about-copy">
My name is Tricia Keogh. My previous experience as a qualified counsellor of 30 years and more recently in the NHS as a Macmillan specialist palliative care nurse, has allowed me insight and a deep understanding of suffering, loss, grief and the challenges that we face at times of change and transition when we feel out of control, scared and uncertain of the future.
<br>
    <br>
The impact of any major life change can lead to a sense of chaos and hopelessness and yet at the same time can be an opportunity to review how past and present patterns and behaviours are affecting decisions and choices we make. At this time there is the possibility of considering how to adapt, stabilise and transform the previously unknown potential that is available to us all. Working in a safe, supportive and confidential place l offer you the chance to explore the impact that lifeâ€™s events have had and how this may offer new opportunities for the future.
